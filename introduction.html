		<p>Because I recognized my interst in coding and the fact that my inborn logical and analitical thinking is a great advantage in this field, I've decided to start a career in programming. Therefore I took a programming course at Ruander Academy in Budapest, and I constantly develop myself through video tutorials and documentations. Now I seek for a work opportunity where I can improve my knowledge in coding. I want to be part of a team where I can learn from others, and where I can contribute to a team's success. Also, I welcome any opportunity to learn new programming languages and new technologies in order to develop myself professionally. I would like to participate in different courses, both professional and soft skills. I enjoy working on innovative ideas and to develop softwares with wich the clients are highly pleased.</p>
